# Intelligent Remote Academia-IRA

The purpose of our project is to build a generalized solution for educational institutions that effectively manage manual tasks in any educational institution. Our project will adopt a smart learning environment including awareness about student’s daily and academic activities which will help their parents to learn more about their child’s academic status so that parents will be updated without visiting the institutions. This system will provide intelligent analysis as well as predictions to students and administrations of an institution to improve their performance and productivity.
